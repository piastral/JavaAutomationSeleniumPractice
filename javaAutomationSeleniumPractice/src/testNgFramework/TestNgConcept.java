 * 
 * 4-cedric beust is the developer of testng framework 
 * 
 * 5-if you want to run test case(A) before that as pre reuestie you need to run multiple test case before 
 * you begin test case (A) ,you can set and map with the help of testNg so that prerequiste test cases run first
 * and than only it will invoke a test case A .in such way you can contol the test case 
 * 
 *  6-testNg framework came after Junit ,and testNg framework add more powerfu, functionality and 
 *  easier to use 
 *  
 *  ADVANTAGES OF TESTNG over Junit
 *
