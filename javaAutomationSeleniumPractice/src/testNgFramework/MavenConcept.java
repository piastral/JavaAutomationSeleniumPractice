/*maven is product of apache organiazation
 * maven is powerful project/build manaagemetn tool
 * that is based on POM(project Object Model) it is used for projects build
 * dependecy and documentation
 * 
 * Based on project Maven can manage a project build ,reoirting
 * and documentation from central piece of information .Using maven
 * we can build and manage java based project
 * 
 * UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM WITHOUT MAVEN ::
 * 1-ADDING SET OF JARS IN EACH PROJECT ::
 * in case of struts ,spring ,hibernate framework we need to add set of jar 
 * files in each project .it must include all depedecies Of jars also
 * 
 * 2-CREATING THE RIGHT PRJECT STRUCTURE ::
 * we must create the right project structure in servlet ,struts etc,otherwise
 * it will not be executed 
 * 
 * 3-BUILDING AND DEPLOYING THE PROJECT ::
 * 
 * WE MUST HAVE TO BUILD AND DEPLOY THE PROJECT SO THAT IT MAY WORK
 * 
 * WHAT TIT DOES??
 * 1-it makes projecteasy to build 
 * 2-it provides uniform build process(maven project can be shared by all the maven projects)
 * 
 * 3-it provides project information(LOg document,cross refenced sources,mailing list,dependency list,
 * unit test reports etc)
 * 
 * 4-it is easy to migrate for new features of maven
 * 
 * MAVEN POM.XML FILE
 * POM(PROJECT OBJECT MODEL) pom.xml file contains information of project and configuration information
 * for the maven to build the project such as dependecy ,build directory,source directory
 * test source directory,plugin ,goals etc
 * maven reads the pom.xml file than executes the goal
 * 
 * ELEMENT ::                     DESCRIPTION::
 * project                       it is the root element of pom.xml file 
 * 
 * modelVersion                  it is the sub element of project it specifies the modelVersion it shoudlbe set
