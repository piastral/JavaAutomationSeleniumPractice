	/*planning for automaion 
	 * 1-feasabilty study analysis ::(YES OR NO) generally by team lead/qa manager its not part of 3 or 4 years 
	 * of experience or my application is feasable or not ,or implementing automation tools is effiecient or NOT
	 *   
	 *2-BUDGET ANALYSIS :: (YES OR NO) here we will check that we have budget or not that we need to hire 
	 *resources we need to check first is it feasaible how many resource we need ,tools we will use
	 * 
	 *3-TECHNOLGY ::(YES OR NO) :: we will check which tools we will use lets say we are working on some
	 *desktop based application that time selenium will not work 
	 *we will see different tools and also we have to budget the cose of the tools 
	 *
	 *4-AVAILIBILTY OF RESOURCES (YES OR NO ):: so how much resource we need to hire in this management 
	 *need to approved lets say we are hiring 6 auto engineers for testing purpose because the project required
	 *big team so hiring will start ...
	 *
	 *5-infrastrucre :: (YES OR NO) NOWDAYS its not important because org is letting employee work remotely
	 *lets say the workstrcutre is you have to be in office than checking is the infrasturce of emloyees are 
	 *good or not...
	 *
	 *lets say if all the avobe factors are good to go that means green signal we start our prject with automation
	 *tools.
	 *
	 *NOW WE WILL FIND THE SCOPE OF AUTOMATION::
	 *in web based :: WE WILL ONLY AUTOMATE (functional and regression test case sceanrios) we will
	 *automate positive scenarios not negative scenarios 
	 *
	 *lets say total is 450 test cases out of 450
	 *210 test cases elegible for AUtomation
	 *
	 *out of 210
	 *100:: smoke test scenario suite based on the requirement we will run the test case 
	 *(lets say every week we need to execture smoke test so we will exexute the smoke test suite)
	 *110::regression test scenario suite 
	 *(and lets say whenever we have release we will run regression test suite)
	 *
	 *FRAMEWORK ::THE SETUP,standard and folder stucture which will follow by everyteam member is called framework
	 *structural way of maintaing or script is called framework 
	 *types : framework
	 *1-built-in  F/w ::JUNIT ,test Ng ,data driven framework
	 *2--USER dEFINED F/w ::hybrid framework
