 * ans::it is testing approach that seperates test instruction (keywords) from test data and test scripts
 * it allows tester to define high level actions using kewyord and associate the with implementation code
 * 
 * lets say for an example we need to test a functinalty for login scenario and logut scenario 
 * thn when we start writing auto script we can divide each features testing based on methods in other words 
 * we can call them as kewyord or instruction and when we want to reuse those methods we can access with 
 * the help of keyword.
