public class AutomationTesting {
/*automation testing : performing testing on the software app /product with the help of autoimation is called automation testing
 * is software testing technique that performs using special automated testing softwarr t o execute test case suite
 * why test automation?
 * repetitve task
 * dufficult to test for milti sites manually 
 * auto test increases the speed of execution 
 * auto testing helos incrtease test coverage 
 * manual testinh is time consumingc
 * different types of auto test tools 3 types 
 * 1- functional testiong tools :- a tools which we are using to test the functonalty of the app 
 * example :- slenium ,qtop,uft,rft
 * 2 api testing tool : test backend api
 * example postman,swagger,restassured
 * 3- perf tools:used to test performance of the application 
 * load runner ,jmeter,silk performer
 * 
 * advantages of using auto tools:
 * by implementing auto test we can save time during performing testing in a project 
 * example:- if we are executing 1 test case manually i 2 hour,same test case we can able to execture in 5 minutues woith
 * the help of auot tools
 * repeta/reuse:-if we want to execute the same test case repetedalt for multiple times ,instead goinh FOR manual testing
 * we can automate the test case with automation tools will work ij less times(regression testing) 
 * 
 * reducing resources:
 * 
 * accuracy : by implemetng auto tes we can maintain the quality during performance testing in a project
 * 	
 * AUTOMATION TESTING PROCESS:
 * in an org may/maynotafter manually test cases were written and manually implemeneted for our flexibilty we will proceed further
 * step 1-testing tool selection (automation)
 * step2-define scope of automation // we will find out what scenarios to automate ,we will never automate negative part
 * step3-planning,design and developlment
 * step4-test execution
 * step5- maintainace
